# Web Disintegration API

This repository details the proposal to add a new API for disintegrating the web:

```js
const result = await navigator.disintegrate("...");
```

The [explainer](./explainer.md) goes gives a high level overview of the proposal.

The [spec](http://goatse.cx/) currently describes how this is being prototyped in Chromium.
